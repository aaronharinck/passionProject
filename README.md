# Personal Passion Project

A Personal passion project is meant to delve deeper into a (new) technology. To show you are capable of lifelong learning. And to explore and research on your own.
Challenge yourself as a developer, it is not a production for a commercial partner.

## Client:

Mainly myself.

Vue.js appears to be loved amongst developers. It is supposed to be easier to get into, make a lot of sense, and have great automatic re-rendering optimizations. And the Vue.js job opportunities keep increasing.

_A great way to learn a technology is to build a functional project with it._

I have always enjoyed playing card games with family and friends and we would often use unofficial rules (aka caf√©regels) to make it more fun.

I want to learn Vue by creating a web card game that allows me to easily play with my friends or family. It should be platform-independent.

## Core Project Statement:

How to use Vue in general, and how (well) can Vue be used as a game interface for a web cardgame?

Make an easily joinable multiplayer web card game using Vue for the interface.
It should work seamlessly across devices and screen sizes.
Security and win conditions should be handled by a server.

## Deliverables:

- A fluid, seamless web game experience
- Reactive UI based on game states
- Join friends easily & play away (URL)
- Extra: Custom games (Set your own rules)
- Extra: Join random people (Matchmaking)
- Extra: friend list for quick invites
